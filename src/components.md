For our Smart Home System for Wastewater Management and Treatment project, here is a list of materials that would typically be used:
1. Microcontroller:<br>
Arduino Uno: Used for interfacing sensors that measure water quality parameters.
2. Single-Board Computer:<br>
Raspberry Pi: Handles advanced data processing, machine learning predictions, and cloud communication.<br>
3. Sensors:<br>
Turbidity Sensor: Measures water clarity to assess suspended solids.<br>
pH Sensor: Monitors water acidity or alkalinity.<br>
TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) Sensor: Detects dissolved substances such as salts and minerals.<br>
Conductivity Sensor: Measures water's electrical conductivity to evaluate purity.<br>
Temperature Sensor (e.g., DS18B20): Monitors the temperature of the water, an important factor in the treatment process.<br>
Water Level Sensor: Measures the water level in the tank to avoid overflow or ensure proper functioning of the system.<br>
Sulfate Analyzer: Measures the concentration of sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻) in the water, which is critical for evaluating water quality in certain treatments.<br>
Chloramine Analyzer: Detects levels of chloramine, a disinfectant used in water treatment, to ensure safe levels in potable water systems.<br>
4. Communication Modules:<br>
Wi-Fi Module: For wireless data transmission to cloud services.<br>
5. Actuators:<br>
Solenoid Valves: Control the flow of water based on sensor data.<br>
Water Pump: Assists in moving water through various stages of the treatment process.<br>
6. Cloud Integration:<br>
Microsoft Azure IoT Hub: Used for real-time monitoring, data storage, and alerts.<br>
7. Relays:
Relay Module: Controls high-power components such as pumps and valves based on sensor inputs.<br>
8. Other Components:<br>
Breadboard & Jumper Wires: For sensor connections during prototyping.<br>
Resistors, Capacitors, Diodes: Support signal conditioning and circuit protection.<br>
9. Software:<br>
Arduino IDE: For programming the Arduino and interfacing with sensors.<br>
Python (Anaconda-Spider): Runs AI models on the Raspberry Pi for predictions and cloud integration.<br>
Proteus: Simulates the system virtually in the absence of physical hardware.<br>
Microsoft Azure: Cloud platform for data analysis, storage, and system monitoring.<br>

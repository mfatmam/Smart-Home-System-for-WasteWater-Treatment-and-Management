For our Smart Home System for Wastewater Management and Treatment project, here is a list of materials that would typically be used:
1. Microcontroller:
Arduino Uno: Used for interfacing sensors that measure water quality parameters.
2. Single-Board Computer:
Raspberry Pi: Handles advanced data processing, machine learning predictions, and cloud communication.
3. Sensors:
Turbidity Sensor: Measures water clarity to assess suspended solids.
pH Sensor: Monitors water acidity or alkalinity.
TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) Sensor: Detects dissolved substances such as salts and minerals.
Conductivity Sensor: Measures water's electrical conductivity to evaluate purity.
Temperature Sensor (e.g., DS18B20): Monitors the temperature of the water, an important factor in the treatment process.
Water Level Sensor: Measures the water level in the tank to avoid overflow or ensure proper functioning of the system.
Sulfate Analyzer: Measures the concentration of sulfate ions (SO₄²⁻) in the water, which is critical for evaluating water quality in certain treatments.
Chloramine Analyzer: Detects levels of chloramine, a disinfectant used in water treatment, to ensure safe levels in potable water systems.
4. Communication Modules:
Wi-Fi Module: For wireless data transmission to cloud services.
5. Actuators:
Solenoid Valves: Control the flow of water based on sensor data.
Water Pump: Assists in moving water through various stages of the treatment process.
6. Cloud Integration:
Microsoft Azure IoT Hub: Used for real-time monitoring, data storage, and alerts.
7. Relays:
Relay Module: Controls high-power components such as pumps and valves based on sensor inputs.
8. Other Components:
Breadboard & Jumper Wires: For sensor connections during prototyping.
Resistors, Capacitors, Diodes: Support signal conditioning and circuit protection.
9. Software:
Arduino IDE: For programming the Arduino and interfacing with sensors.
Python: Runs AI models on the Raspberry Pi for predictions and cloud integration.
Proteus: Simulates the system virtually in the absence of physical hardware.
Microsoft Azure: Cloud platform for data analysis, storage, and system monitoring.
